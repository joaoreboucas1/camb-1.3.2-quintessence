Comments on this model:

1. Initial values for different masses (in Mpl): alpha * phi**-1
m	phi_0
6 x 10^(-24)	9525
5 x 10^(-24)	3826
4 x 10^(-24) 	1253
3 x 10^(-24) 	297
2 x 10^(-24)	39 (the field rolls a little bit; if m greater than this, the field gets frozen and mimics lcdm)
1 x 10^(-24)	0.9 (the field is rolling, starting to get some differences!!)
9 x 10^(-25)	can't find initial conditions! there is a major jump in initial conditions...

	phi**-2
